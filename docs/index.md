# MIMIR

Welcome to Mímirs well!

`MIMIR` is a project by the research group [Digitale Forschung in der Altnordistik](https://nordistik.philhist.unibas.ch/de/forschung/arbeitsgruppe-digitale-forschung-in-der-altnordistik/)
at the University of Basel. The group consists of  five early career researchers in Nordic Studies and was founded 
in 2020. The group’s aim is to examine data and digital resources on Scandinavian literary transmission, and to discuss
opportunities and limitations of computer assisted research.

The present tool, "MIMIR", aims to shed new light on the data found on [Handrit.is](https://handrit.is/), 
beyond what their user interface can show. It is written in Python using the UI framework Streamlit.

For any information on how to use it etc., please consult this documentation.
