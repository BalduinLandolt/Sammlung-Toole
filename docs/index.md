# Sammlung Toole

Welcome to Ultima Toole!

`Sammlung Toole` is a project by the "Arbeitsgruppe Digitale Arbeitsmethoden in der Altnordistik" at the University of Basel.

The tool aims to shed new light on the data found on [Handrit.is](https://handrit.is/), beyond what their user interface can show.

It is written in Python using the UI framework Streamlit.

For any information on how to use it etc., please consult this documentation.
