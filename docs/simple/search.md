# Search Functions

## What to search for

There are multiple search options that can be selected through the radio buttons in the sidebar:

- Handrit URLs:  
  Use one/multiple search- or browse result URL from Handrit.is.  
  The tool will find the manuscripts as returned by Handrit.is, and show the according metadata.  
  This is handy, if you have already found an interestiong set if manuscripts while searching on Handrit.is, and want to get the same manuscripts displayed in the tool.


- Manuscript by Person:  
  Select one/multiple persons form the Handrit.is authority file.  
  The tool will find all manuscripts related to one/all of the selected people.


- Person by Manuscript:  
  Select one/multiple manuscripts form the Handrit.is collection.  
  The tool will find all people related to one/all of the selected manuscripts.


- Manuscript by Text:  
  Select one/multiple texts mentioned in the Handrit.is collections.  
  The tool will find all manuscripts related to one/all of the selected texts.


- Text by Manuscript:  
  Select one/multiple manuscripts form the Handrit.is collection.  
  The tool will find all texts occuring in one/all of the selected manuscripts.


## Search Mode: Union/Intersection, AND/OR

For each search type, it's possible to search for one or multiple entities (e.g. multiple people, search links or shelfmarks).  
For each search, it's also necessary to pick a search mode. The two options are:

- `AND` (Intersection)
- `OR` (Union)

When searching for only one entity, the search mode does not make any difference.  
When searching for two or more entities, the search mode determines, if

- a manuscript must match *one (or more)* of the entities searched for (union)
- a manuscript must match *all* of the entities searched for (intersection)

in order to match the search criteria.
