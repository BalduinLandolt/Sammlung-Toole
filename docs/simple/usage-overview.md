# Usage Overview


## What to find on MÍMIR?

The application presents an optic on manuscript data from [Handrit.is](https://handrit.is/), which is openly available 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/Handrit/Manuscripts). It allows for slightly different search queries, and for direct 
comparison of manuscripts by presenting their metadata in tabular form; it even provides some data visualization.  
None of the data from Handrit.is have been modified or altered manually, however some data have been aggregated and
extracted automatically: Most notably so, the catalogue entries in multiple languages are unified, in hope to provide 
the most complete metadata possible.


## Where to find MÍMIR?

Currently, no public server is available. For access to the *super secret* internal server, please get in touch with us.

Alternatively, you can run the tool locally on your computer, by following [these instructions](../advanced-usage.md).


## How to use MÍMIR?

Once you have access to the tool (be that on a server or locally), simply open the URL in your browser.

On normal screen sizes, you will see the navigation bar on the left side on the page.

*Fig.: Page Navigation*

> If you don't see the navigation bar, there is a chance it's just collapsed/hidden. Look out for a little arrow on the 
> very left edge of the screen.

> On small screens, especially on mobile devices, the layout may look slightly different. You will find your way around 
> it, no doubt.

In the navigation bar, you can simply select a page, and the application will take you there. You can familiarize 
yourself with the available data on the [Browse](browse.md) page, search the data on the [Search](search.md) page
and store, combine or visualize search results on the [Groups](groups.md) page.

When you have a set of manuscripts that interests you, the app will provide you with metadata on these manuscripts
for further investigation, that can then be downloaded as a CSV spreadsheet for later use. The application will even
provide you with some visualizations of the data out of the box.
