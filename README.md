All commands that need running, should be executed from a terminal/command-line-interface that is opened in the root folder of this repo (i.e. the same folder as this file is located).

To open a terminal in this folder, use one of the following options:

- Open the folder in windows explorer, and in the navigation bar, replace the file path with `cmd` and hit enter.
- In Github Desktop, click `Repository > Open in Command Prompt`.
- Open the folder in VS Code and click `View > Terminal`.
- Download and install "Windows Terminal", which enables you to right-click on a folder and select `Open in Windows Terminal`.
- Open a command prompt and navigate to the desired folder using the command `cd` (google how it works).


## Requirements

### Install all requirements

To install all required packages, simply run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
